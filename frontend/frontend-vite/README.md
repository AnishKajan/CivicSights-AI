‚ÑπÔ∏è Original Vite Template Info
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

#Currently, two official plugins are available:
@vitejs/plugin-react uses Babel for Fast Refresh

@vitejs/plugin-react-swc uses SWC for Fast Refresh

#üì¶ Future Improvement Ideas
Add TypeScript support

Add Nginx or Caddy for production proxying

Auto-restart frontend/backend with volume mounts
